Tutorial on Neural Networks

Fangfang Xia

Topics:

* Unsupervised learning
* Supervised Learning

We will be using examples from the Keras framework.
Keras can be installed/updated with:

`pip install -U keras`

Hands-on:

* Motivating example: learning addition with sequence to sequence model
* Keras MNIST MLP
* Keras MNIST Autoencoder
* Keras MNIST Denoising Autoencoder
* Semi-supervised learning on the circles example
